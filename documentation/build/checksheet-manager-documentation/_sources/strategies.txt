Strategies
==============================================
The primary strategy for populating an empty checksheet management system lies in divison of labour.

Ideally, the first root user would add all the department heads into the system as fellow root user.

The department heads would then add their department info and all of the classes offered by the department into the system. In big universities this process would be given some time and careful consideration.

Once the classes have been populated into the system, the department heads would their department members (advisors) into the system along with their information. 

The advisors then would be assigned the task of creating empty checksheets and ensuring solid rules have been enforced on the checksheet.

Finally, the checksheet mangement system would be made live to the student by allowing advisors to add students by matching them with previously created empty checksheets.
