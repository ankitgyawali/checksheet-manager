The second option simply provides information (class pre-requisite requirements and other rules) of the slot. 

The third "note", option simply lets you add notes to the slot. This can be anything, the name of professor you took the class with, your grade in the class etc.

The fourth and final delete option simply resets the slot back getting rid of the slot note & "taken" status. 

Lastly students can also, request appointment with their advisor by chossing the last option on the right menu. This will bring up a page from where students can reserve open time slots provided by their advisors.
