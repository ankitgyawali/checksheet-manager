Installation Instructions
==============================================

As it has been mentioned before, feel free to report any issues at `the official issues`_ page on github. This installation instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 but should be enough for any unix system.

Checksheet manager runs as a node js application. Because we are running a web application and not traditional static files, we run node js with nginx. Running nginx and apache along side requires some researching into if you are switching from an apache only server. Below are the steps to build and run checksheet-manager on a debian based operating system. 

Start off by cloning the repository with::

    git clone https://github.com/ankitgyawali/checksheet-manager.git

Install Node JS, Mongo DB and PM2 on your system. Heres a quick little script that installs node::

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install git
    cd ~
    wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v4.2.3/node-v4.2.3-linux-x64.tar.gz
    mkdir node
    tar xvf node-v*.tar.gz --strip-components=1 -C ./node
    cd ~
    rm -rf node-v*
    mkdir node/etc
    echo 'prefix=/usr/local' > node/etc/npmrc
    sudo mv node /opt/
    sudo chown -R root: /opt/node
    sudo ln -s /opt/node/bin/node /usr/local/bin/node
    sudo ln -s /opt/node/bin/npm /usr/local/bin/npm

At this point node -v should give you the version of node js.

Set up your server's private ip address on checksheet-manager/server/server.js.

You can get your private ip address if its set up by::


    curl -w "\n" http://169.254.169.254/metadata/v1/interfaces/private/0/ipv4/address 

While you are at it, you could set up the name of your institution on checksheet manager. You can do so by modifying the cmTitle parameter on checksheet-manager/client/configuration.js.

Install pm2::

    sudo npm install pm2 -g
    pm2 startup ubuntu
    cd checksheet-manager/server
    pm2 start server

At this point you should have node.js and pm2 installed. We now need mongodb(for database) and nginx(to run the app) on our system. There is a guide to install mongodb which can be found here. Once you are done start mongod by running, sudo service mongod start and make sure the service is running by running, sudo service mongod status.

Finall to install nginx, run: sudo apt-get install nginx. Modify your nginx parameters via:: 

    sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/default 

The default config should look somthing similar to this::

    server {
        listen 80;

        server_name yourservername.com;
    
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://APP_PRIVATE_IP_ADDRESS:8080;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }
    }

Restart nginx service with sudo service nginx restart. To instantiate your first root user to be able to populate more accounts, you need to insert your first root user via mongo shell. To do this execute mongo to enter the mongo shell(look for 'robomongo' if you dont want to learn mongo shell) and execute the following commands::

    use ksm
    db.createCollection("root");
    db.root.insert({"username":"root","password":"rootPassw0rd"})

This will instantiate your first root user and you can add more accounts from that root account. You should be all set and ready to go with the login information you just inserted to the mongo database(username: root and password: rootPassw0rd).
