Front-End/Back-End Interaction
==============================================


The following libraries and frameworks were used for the front end:

 * JQuery
 * Bootstrap
 * Angular JS
 * Angular-animate
 * Angular-routes
 * Angular-filter
 * Angular-cookies
 * Angular-toastr
 * Angular-ui-bootstrap
 * Angular-confirm
 * Angular-password

 For the back-end the framework and modules used were:

 * NodeJS
 * Express
 * MongoDB
 * Mongoose ORM

As with other modern web applications, the front-end simply fetched the data from APIs that were created using Node & Mongoose on the back-end, stores it in local session by utilizing angular-cookies and uses angular js to render it appropriately.
