Words from the developer
==============================================

I would like to thank all my proffesors, friends & family for the support.

This one is dedicated to `Dr Dale Parson`_. I am sure his obvious passion for programming and teaching has inspired a lot of programmers.

Thanks to `Dr Robert Folk`_ for providing me an opportunity to document this code. 

Also, thanks to `Dr Randy Kaplan`_ for helping me make my decision to turn this idea into reality.
